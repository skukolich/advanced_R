## R Markdown

Germany gdp has increased over time. Japan increased over time. Honduras had a spike in the 1970s.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data.csv",header = TRUE)
head(dat)
final_project<-subset(dat, dat$country == "Honduras"| dat$country == "Germany"| dat$country == "Japan")
head(final_project)
analyze <- function(countr) {
  country_data <- subset(final_project, final_project$country == countr)
  plot(country_data$year, country_data$gdpPercap , xlab = "Year", ylab= "gdpPercap", main=countr)
}
analyze("Germany") 
analyze("Japan")   
analyze("Honduras")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
